# OctoAcme â€” Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (facilitated by Project Manager or Agile Coach)
2. Requirements gathering and documentation (led by Business Analyst with Product Manager)
3. Design workshops and user research (UX/UI Designer with stakeholders)
4. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (Product Manager with Business Analyst)
5. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points with development team)
6. Define Definition of Done (DoD) (team agreement, facilitated by Agile Coach)
7. Identify dependencies and integration points (Project Manager with technical leads)
8. Review infrastructure and deployment requirements (DevOps Engineer)
9. Create release plan and milestone map (Release Manager with Project Manager)
