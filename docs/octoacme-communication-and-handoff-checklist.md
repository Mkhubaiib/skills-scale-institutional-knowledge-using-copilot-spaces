# OctoAcme — Communication & Handoff Checklist

## Purpose
Ensure smooth transitions between project phases and team members by providing clear handoff criteria and communication templates.

## General Handoff Best Practices
- Schedule a dedicated handoff meeting with both parties present
- Document all handoff artifacts in a central location (project board, shared docs)
- Provide context, not just deliverables (explain decisions made and constraints)
- Allow time for questions and clarifications
- Confirm receipt and understanding before considering handoff complete
