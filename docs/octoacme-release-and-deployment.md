  - Trigger incident response and notify on-call (DevOps Engineer initiates)
  - Rollback to last known-good release if necessary (executed by DevOps Engineer, approved by Release Manager)
  - Triage root cause and capture action items (cross-functional team)
  - Communicate status to stakeholders (Release Manager and Project Manager)
  - Schedule post-incident review (facilitated by Agile Coach or Project Manager)
